# define the isotopomers here

# isotopomer name, atom number in ground state, atom number in transition state, valid replacement atomic weight (must be specified in weights.dat)
#
#
# for example, 'isotopomer tritium 2 4 3' replaces atom 2 in the gs with tritium and atom 4 in the ts with tritium
# add additional isotopomer lines with the same name to give multiple replacements within a single isotopomer

# the name reference was selected above as the reference isotopomer

# this is identical to the reference isotopomer and therefore ought to product a value of 1.00 (which it does)
