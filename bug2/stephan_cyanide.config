#
# isotopomer name, atom number in ground state, atom number in transition state, valid replacement atomic weight (must be specified in weights.dat)
#
# for example, 'isotopomer abc 2 4 C13' replaces atom 2 in the gs and atom 4 in the ts with carbon-13
# and calls the resulting KIE "abc"
#
# add additional isotopomer lines with the same name to give multiple replacements within a single isotopomer

# the name reference was selected above as the reference isotopomer

isotopomer cyanide_C 2 10 13C
#isotopomer cyanide_N 1 11 15N

# this is identical to the reference isotopomer and therefore ought to produce a value of 1.00 (which it does)
#isotopomer C5 5 5 13C
#isotopomer C6 6 6 13C

# example of doing a multiple replacement
#isotopomer H/D 7 7 2D
#isotopomer H/D 8 8 2D
