    "The `autoquiver` module implements functionality to perform screening over a large number of files. It's command line use is described in depth in the README. Here we will see how to leverage Python to have more sophisticated uses for `autoquiver`. Suppose we have the following files that we want to use as inputs to `PyQuiver`:\n",

    "* `filepath`: this is the target directory.\n",
    "* `config_path`: the location of the configuration file to use for all *PyQuiver* calculations\n",
    "* `input_extension`: the file extension for ground and transition state files (DEFAULT=.out)\n",
    "* `style`: the style of the ground and transition state files (DEFAULT=g09)\n",

    "```\n",

The character \"-\" was used as a field delimiter and \"gs\" and \"ts\" matched if all fields after the first were identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is some sensible default behaviour, but the underlying interface is much more powerful. In general, we need the following three arguments\n",
    "* `gs_p`: a function that takes a filename and returns a boolean value. `True` if the filename corresponds to a ground state and `False` if it does not.\n",
    "* `ts_p`: a function that takes a filename and returns a boolean value. `True` if the filename corresponds to a transition state and `False` if it does not.\n",
