# define the isotopomers here
#
# isotopomer number, atom number in ground state, atom number in transition state, replacement atomic weight
#
# isotopomer number should start at 1 and increase 1 at a time
#
# for example, isotopomer 1 2 4 3 replaces atom 2 in the gs with tritium and atom 4 in the ts with tritium
# add additional lines to give multiple replacements within a single isotopomer
